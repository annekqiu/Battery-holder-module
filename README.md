# Battery-holder-module
this is an electronic module used to regulate the voltage of the battery CR2032
when I did the L-ink project, the power circuit is the same with this project. 
I met a problem, the battery outputs 3.1V,and the IC outputs 2.7V,it did not get 3.3V (theoretically).
20211030 I found this project.I hope I can get something to solve my problem.
